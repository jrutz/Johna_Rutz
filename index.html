	<h2>Independent Project</h2>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>In the spirit of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the actual guide, not the Douglas Adams book),
	this semester's challenge will be to put together a travel compendium. A website that includes 
		helpful hints, metro maps, stories from abroad, and general travel information. It will be designed to be
		aesthetically pleasing, mildly amusing, and a little bit useful. </p>
		
	<h3>Users</h3>
	<p>Young to middle-aged people who enjoy travelling and have a variety of experience in travelling. 
	They're likely looking for a way to get organized, to get ideas, or to get information all in one place. 
	With money to travel, a large subsection will probably carry iphones or ipads instead of computers,
	making mobile development key. </p>
	
	
	
	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<h4>For website as a whole</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Usable for the well travelled and those who wish to be</li>
		<li>Combination of lists and informative articles</li>
		<li>Eventually (long-term) to create an environment for a community</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>For landing page</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Clear navigation to rest of site(learnable)</li>
		<li>Attractive layout (delightful)</li>
		<li>Easily searchable if there's a particular goal (efficient)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div style="text-align:center;">
	There are currently two landing pages:<p>
	<i>The goal is not to make money but instead to have people continue to desire to use the site. An email 
	list will be set up, but the introduction should feel welcoming rather than pushy. I want to make the user
	feel like we're doing them a favor and like this product was specially created with them in mind. 
	Conversion is tracked through Google Analytics as they are re-directed to the homepage 
	through the only button on the screen.</i></p>
