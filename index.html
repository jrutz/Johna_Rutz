	<h2>Independent Project</h2>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>In the spirit of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the actual guide, not the Douglas Adams book),
	this semester's challenge will be to put together a travel compendium. A website that includes 
		helpful hints, metro maps, stories from abroad, and general travel information. It will be designed to be
		aesthetically pleasing, mildly amusing, and a little bit useful. </p>
		
	<h3>Users</h3>
	<p>Young to middle-aged people who enjoy travelling and have a variety of experience in travelling. 
	They're likely looking for a way to get organized, to get ideas, or to get information all in one place. 
	With money to travel, a large subsection will probably carry iphones or ipads instead of computers,
	making mobile development key. </p>
	
	
	
	<h3>Goals</h3>

	<li>Usable for the well travelled and those who wish to be</li>
