While iHealth is attractive and great for displaying information, if using only this it requires you to enter every value manually which gets tedious if you are attempting to track many health-related variables. 
A pro is that it has the ability to sync with many different applications to speed up the process, but it is not a fantastic app in and of itself.

LoseIt allows you to enter meals, workouts, and track weight, it has a relatively good database, but it requires a log in every time, is not particularly aesthetically pleasing, and has ads which are 
unrelated to the goal.

MyFitnessPal draws from a large database, it syncs with other fitness apps to create a dynamic calorie count and allows you to add
recipes which the nutrition is then drawn from automatically. The main con to this is that is not meant to
track exercises, although it has a large database, the system for entering reps/weights/etc. is tedious and not at all delightful.
